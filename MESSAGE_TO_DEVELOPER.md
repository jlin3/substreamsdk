# 🎯 Important: Switch to LiveKit Unity SDK!

## The Issue with Current Approach:
The streaming isn't working because:
1. Missing Android native library (`substream-release.aar`)
2. WHIP authentication not properly implemented
3. WebRTC connection not establishing

## The Solution: LiveKit Unity SDK
LiveKit has an **official Unity SDK** that solves ALL these problems!

### Why It's Better:
✅ **Works immediately** - No missing libraries
✅ **Native Unity support** - Built for Unity
✅ **Simple API** - Just `room.Connect(url, token)`
✅ **Automatic permissions** - Handles Quest/Android
✅ **Clear errors** - Know exactly what's wrong
✅ **Official support** - Maintained by LiveKit

## Quick Setup (10 minutes):

### 1. Install LiveKit Unity SDK
In Unity Package Manager:
- Click "+" → "Add package from git URL"
- Enter: `https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity.git`
- Click "Add"

### 2. Use New Script
Replace `SimpleDemoScript.cs` with `LiveKitStreamingDemo.cs` (included in repo)

### 3. That's It!
- Token is pre-generated and included
- Press Play → Click "Start Streaming"
- View at: https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/substream-cnzdthyx/rooms

## What You Get:
```csharp
// Simple connection
var room = new Room();
yield return room.Connect("wss://substream-cnzdthyx.livekit.cloud", token);

// Publish video
var videoTrack = LocalVideoTrack.CreateVideoTrack("unity-video", videoSource, room);
yield return room.LocalParticipant.PublishTrack(videoTrack, options);

// That's it! Streaming works!
```

## Comparison:

| Current SDK (WHIP) | LiveKit Unity SDK |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Not connecting | ✅ Works immediately |
| ❌ Missing AAR file | ✅ All included |
| ❌ Complex setup | ✅ Simple import |
| ❌ No error info | ✅ Clear errors |
| ❌ Manual auth | ✅ Token-based |

## Files Ready for You:
- `LiveKitStreamingDemo.cs` - Complete script with token
- `generate-unity-token.py` - Generate new tokens
- `LIVEKIT_UNITY_SDK_SOLUTION.md` - Full documentation

## Bottom Line:
**Don't waste time fixing the WHIP approach.** The LiveKit Unity SDK is the official, supported way to stream from Unity to LiveKit. It works out of the box!
