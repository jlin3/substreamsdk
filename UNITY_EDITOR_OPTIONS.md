# Unity Editor Streaming Options (No Quest Required!)

You have **3 options** to stream from Unity Editor without Quest:

## Option 1: Unity Editor Demo (Works Now!)
Use `UnityEditorStreaming.cs` - Creates real LiveKit rooms from Unity Editor

**What it does:**
- ✅ Creates LiveKit rooms
- ✅ Generates access tokens
- ✅ Provides viewer links
- ✅ Shows streaming UI
- ⚠️ No actual video (but room is ready)

**Setup:**
1. Add `UnityEditorStreaming.cs` to any GameObject
2. Press Play in Unity
3. Press SPACE to start
4. Get room name from console
5. Join room at meet.livekit.io

## Option 2: Screen Sharing (Full Video!)
Use the existing `WorkingStreamSolution.cs`

**What it does:**
- ✅ Creates rooms
- ✅ You share Unity Game window
- ✅ Full video streaming
- ✅ Viewers see your game

**Setup:**
1. Add `WorkingStreamSolution.cs` to scene
2. Press Play
3. Press SPACE
4. Go to meet.livekit.io
5. Join room and click "Share Screen"
6. Select Unity Game window
7. Viewers see your Unity game!

## Option 3: Unity Render Streaming (Advanced)
Install Unity's official package for WebRTC streaming

**Setup:**
1. Window → Package Manager
2. Add from git URL: `com.unity.renderstreaming`
3. Follow Unity's WebRTC setup
4. More complex but captures directly

## Quick Comparison:

| Method | Video? | Complexity | Use Case |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| UnityEditorStreaming.cs | No* | Easy | Test room creation |
| WorkingStreamSolution.cs | Yes (screen share) | Easy | Full demo |
| Unity Render Streaming | Yes | Complex | Production |

*Room is created, just needs video source

## For Tomorrow's Demo:

**Easiest approach:**
1. Use `WorkingStreamSolution.cs`
2. Share your Unity Game window
3. Shows actual gameplay
4. Works immediately

**OR if you want to show Quest-specific:**
1. Build to Quest with `QuestStreamingEasySetup.cs`
2. Shows MediaProjection capture
3. True mobile VR streaming

Both work great for demos!
