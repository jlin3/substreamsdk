# The Truth About Current State üîç

## What Actually Works Right Now:

### ‚úÖ Working:
- Creates real LiveKit rooms on your cloud
- Generates proper access tokens
- Viewers can join the room
- One-click viewer access (direct URL)
- Room management and infrastructure

### ‚ùå NOT Working Yet:
- **No video streaming** - Unity's camera is NOT being captured
- **No audio** - No microphone capture
- **Empty room** - Viewers join but see black screen

## Why No Video?

Even with LiveKit Unity SDK imported, you need:

1. **Camera Capture** - Convert Unity camera ‚Üí video stream
2. **Video Encoding** - Hardware encode to H.264/VP8
3. **WebRTC Publishing** - Send encoded video to LiveKit
4. **Track Management** - Handle video track lifecycle

The current script has placeholder code but doesn't implement these.

## What Viewers See:

When they click the viewer link:
1. They join the LiveKit room ‚úÖ
2. They see participant list ‚úÖ
3. They see "unity-streamer" connected ‚úÖ
4. But NO video feed (black screen) ‚ùå

## To Get Video Working:

### Option 1: Full LiveKit Integration
```csharp
// Needs implementation:
- Camera render texture capture
- Video track creation
- Proper WebRTC connection
- Frame encoding pipeline
```

### Option 2: Screen Share Approach
- Capture entire Unity window
- Less elegant but simpler

### Option 3: Third-Party Solutions
- Unity Render Streaming
- FMETP Stream
- Custom WebRTC implementation

## The Honest Demo:

"This demonstrates the LiveKit Cloud infrastructure integration. The room creation, authentication, and viewer access all work perfectly. Video capture from Unity requires additional implementation - we're showing the streaming infrastructure is ready."

## Why This Happened:

We focused on the infrastructure (which works!) but the actual Unity‚ÜíVideo‚ÜíWebRTC pipeline is complex and needs proper implementation beyond just importing an SDK.

## For Your Demo:

1. **Show what works** - Room creation, instant viewer access
2. **Be transparent** - "Video capture is the next implementation step"
3. **Focus on ease** - "One click creates global streaming room"
4. **Infrastructure wins** - "No servers, scales automatically"

The button‚Üíviewer flow is now super simple, but there's no actual video being streamed yet.
