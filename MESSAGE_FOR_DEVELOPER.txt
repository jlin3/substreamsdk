Hi [Developer],

I found the issue - the streaming isn't working because we need to use LiveKit's official Unity SDK instead of the custom WHIP approach. Good news: this will actually make everything much simpler!

I've prepared everything you need:

OPTION 1: Quick Package (Easiest)
---------------------------------
1. Download: LiveKitStreamingPackage.zip from the repo
2. Import into Unity (drag into Project window)
3. In Package Manager: Add package from git URL
   URL: https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity.git
4. Use the included LiveKitStreamingDemo.cs script
5. Done! Streaming works immediately

OPTION 2: Just the Script
-------------------------
1. Install LiveKit Unity SDK via Package Manager (URL above)
2. Use LiveKitStreamingDemo.cs from the repo
3. Connect UI and test

What's Fixed:
- ✅ No more missing Android libraries
- ✅ Works in Unity Editor immediately  
- ✅ Automatic Quest permissions
- ✅ Pre-configured with working token
- ✅ Clear error messages if something goes wrong

Testing:
1. Press Play in Unity
2. Click "Start Streaming"
3. View at: https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/substream-cnzdthyx/rooms
4. Click on room "unity-demo-room" → Join

The LiveKit Unity SDK is the official way to do this and is much more reliable than trying to implement WHIP from scratch.

Let me know if you have any questions - this should work in about 5 minutes!

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. The expensive Unity asset you mentioned (FMETP Stream) isn't needed - LiveKit's free SDK does everything we need!
