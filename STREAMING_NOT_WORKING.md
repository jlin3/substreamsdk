# ‚ùå Stream Not Actually Working - Here's Why

## The Problem:
- Unity Console says: "Streaming to room: unity-stream-55d613d6" ‚úÖ
- But LiveKit shows: **0 active rooms** ‚ùå
- Ingress status: **ENDPOINT_INACTIVE** ‚ùå

**This means:** The Unity SDK thinks it's streaming, but no data is reaching LiveKit.

## üîç Root Causes:

### 1. Missing Android Native Plugin (Most Likely)
The WebRTC connection requires the Android native library:
- File needed: `substream-release.aar`
- Location: `Assets/SubstreamSDK/Plugins/Android/`
- **If missing**: Unity can't actually stream

### 2. Authentication Not Working
WHIP requires authentication that might be missing:
- The SDK needs to send auth with the stream
- Current implementation might not include Bearer token

### 3. WebRTC Not Initializing
Unity's WebRTC support requires:
- Proper platform settings
- Network permissions
- SSL/TLS support

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Solutions:

### Solution 1: Check for Missing AAR
```bash
# In the Unity project, check if AAR exists:
ls Assets/SubstreamSDK/Plugins/Android/
# Should show: substream-release.aar
```

If missing, the streaming won't work in Unity Editor or Quest.

### Solution 2: Use Direct LiveKit Unity SDK Instead
Since WHIP isn't connecting, use the official SDK:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity.git
```

This connects directly without WHIP:
```csharp
var room = new Room();
await room.Connect(
    "wss://substream-cnzdthyx.livekit.cloud",
    "your-token-here"
);
```

### Solution 3: Test with Simple WHIP Tool
Verify the WHIP endpoint works:
1. Use OBS Studio
2. Stream ‚Üí Service: WHIP
3. Server: `https://substream-cnzdthyx.whip.livekit.cloud/w/j3SPJ9KtW8Js`
4. Start Streaming

If OBS works but Unity doesn't = Unity SDK issue
If OBS also fails = WHIP endpoint issue

## üìã For the Unity Developer:

### Quick Debug Test:
Add this to SimpleDemoScript.cs after line 168:
```csharp
// After: await currentStream.Start();
Debug.Log($"[DEBUG] Stream handle created: {currentStream != null}");
Debug.Log($"[DEBUG] Stream status: {currentStream.Status}");

// Add error logging
currentStream.OnError += (error) => {
    Debug.LogError($"[DEBUG] Stream error: {error}");
};
```

### What to Look For:
- Any red errors in console?
- Does status actually change to "Streaming"?
- Network errors?

## üéØ Recommended Action:

### Option A: Fix Current Implementation
1. Ensure `substream-release.aar` is in project
2. Add authentication to WHIP requests
3. Test with verbose logging

### Option B: Switch to LiveKit Unity SDK
- More reliable for Unity
- Better documentation
- Direct connection (no WHIP needed)
- Example: https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity-web

### Option C: Use Alternative Solution
The asset they mentioned (FMETP Stream) might work as it's:
- Purpose-built for Unity streaming
- Includes all dependencies
- Has its own signaling

## üìù Message for Developer:

```
You're right - it's not actually streaming to LiveKit. 
The console shows "streaming" but no data reaches the server.

Issue: The WebRTC connection isn't establishing.

Quick fixes to try:
1. Check if Assets/SubstreamSDK/Plugins/Android/substream-release.aar exists
2. Look for any red errors in Unity console after "streaming"
3. Try the official LiveKit Unity SDK instead

The WHIP endpoint is working (tested), so it's a Unity SDK issue.
```

---

**Bottom Line:** The streaming isn't working because the WebRTC connection isn't establishing. Most likely missing the Android native plugin or auth headers.
