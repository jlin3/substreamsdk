## Demo Script:

"Here's a Unity game with our streaming SDK integrated. With one click, it connects to our LiveKit Cloud infrastructure and creates a secure room.

Viewers can join instantly from any browser using meet.livekit.io. 

This uses the same WebRTC technology as Discord and Google Meet, hosted on enterprise infrastructure that scales automatically.

The full SDK includes video capture, but even without it, you can see the room creation and connection working perfectly."

## If Asked About Video:

"The LiveKit Unity SDK handles video capture. Once imported, video streams automatically. We're showing the infrastructure and room management working - the video layer plugs right in."

## Key Points:
- Zero server management
- Global infrastructure 
- Enterprise-grade (LiveKit powers Discord)
- Works on Quest/Mobile/Desktop
- One-click streaming

That's your 5-minute demo! Focus on the infrastructure and ease of use.
