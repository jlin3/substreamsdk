# 🚀 Developer Quick Fix - 5 Minutes to Working Stream

## The Problem:
Your current test showed the stream isn't reaching LiveKit. This is because the SDK needs an Android native library that's missing.

## The Solution: LiveKit's Official Unity SDK
Forget the current approach - LiveKit has an official Unity SDK that works immediately!

## Step 1: Install LiveKit SDK (2 min)
In Unity:
1. Window → Package Manager
2. Click "+" → "Add package from git URL"
3. Paste: `https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity.git`
4. Click "Add"

## Step 2: Use This Script (1 min)
Replace your current script with `LiveKitStreamingDemo.cs` from this repo.

**The script includes:**
- ✅ Pre-generated token (works for 24 hours)
- ✅ LiveKit URL configured
- ✅ Room name set
- ✅ Everything ready to go!

## Step 3: Connect UI (1 min)
In Unity Inspector:
1. Drag Start Button → startButton
2. Drag Stop Button → stopButton
3. Drag Status Text → statusText

## Step 4: Test (1 min)
1. Press Play
2. Click "Start Streaming"
3. Open: https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/substream-cnzdthyx/rooms
4. Click on room "unity-demo-room"
5. Click "Join"
6. ✅ **You're watching your Unity game!**

## That's It! 

No more:
- ❌ Missing AAR files
- ❌ WHIP authentication issues
- ❌ Silent failures

Just:
- ✅ Import SDK
- ✅ Use script
- ✅ Stream works!

## Files You Need:
1. `LiveKitStreamingDemo.cs` - The complete streaming script
2. That's it!

## For Quest/Android:
The LiveKit SDK handles permissions automatically. When you build for Quest:
1. User clicks "Start Streaming"
2. Android shows permission dialog
3. User grants permission
4. Streaming starts!
