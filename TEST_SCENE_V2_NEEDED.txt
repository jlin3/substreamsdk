TEST SCENE V2 - ACTION NEEDED
=============================

The old test-scene.unitypackage has been archived because it contains
conflicting scripts (Substream.cs, DemoController.cs).

TO CREATE test-scene-v2.unitypackage:

1. In Unity, import the old package from:
   archived-scripts/test-scene-old.unitypackage

2. DELETE these files:
   - Assets/SubstreamSDK/Scripts/Substream.cs
   - Assets/SubstreamSDK/Demos/Scripts/DemoController.cs

3. Keep only the visual assets:
   - Test scene
   - Cube, particles, materials
   - UI elements

4. Export as test-scene-v2.unitypackage

5. Place in root directory

This will give us a clean test scene without script conflicts!
