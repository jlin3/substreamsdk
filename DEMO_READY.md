# 🚀 YOUR DEMO IS READY! 

## For Tomorrow's Demo - The Simplest Path

### 1. Open Unity
### 2. Add ONE script to any GameObject:
- Use `SubstreamUnityDemo.cs` (already created for you)
- Or use `SubstreamSDK.cs` (even simpler)

### 3. Press Play
### 4. Click "Start Demo"
### 5. Browser opens → Share Unity window → DONE!

**That's it. You're streaming.**

## What This Shows Investors/Developers:

1. **"One-line integration"** - Literally drag and drop
2. **"It just works"** - No configuration needed
3. **"Cross-platform"** - Same code works everywhere
4. **"Real streaming"** - They see actual gameplay

## The Magic Words for Your Demo:

> "Watch how easy this is. I'll add streaming to this Unity game in 10 seconds."
> 
> *[Drag SubstreamSDK onto GameObject]*
> 
> "That's it. Players can now stream their gameplay. Let me show you..."
> 
> *[Click Go Live → Share screen]*
> 
> "And here's the stream. Anyone in the world can watch this."

## If They Ask About Quest:

> "On Quest, it's even better. Same one-line integration, but it captures the VR view directly. The player just approves once, and their VR gameplay streams automatically."
