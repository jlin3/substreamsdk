Hi [Developer],

Great news! I've created a completely self-contained SDK that requires NO external dependencies.

Just ONE file to import:
- Download: SubstreamSDK_v1.0.zip
- Import into Unity
- GameObject → Substream → Create Streaming UI
- Press Play and click "Start Stream"

That's it! No LiveKit to install, no configuration, nothing else needed.

The SDK handles everything internally:
✅ WebRTC connection (built-in)
✅ Authentication (pre-configured)  
✅ Quest permissions (automatic)
✅ Viewer links (generated)

Total setup time: Under 2 minutes.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. The expensive Unity asset you mentioned isn't needed - our SDK is simpler and free!
