Subject: Quick Unity SDK Test - 30 minutes

Hi [Developer Name],

I need someone to test our Unity streaming SDK on Meta Quest. It should take about 30 minutes.

Repo: https://github.com/jlin3/substreamsdk

What to test:
1. Import StreamTestScene.unitypackage into Unity
2. Add SimpleDemoScript.cs and connect to buttons
3. Test in Unity Editor (should show "LIVE - Streaming!")
4. Build for Quest and test permission flow
5. Check viewer at: https://substreamapp.surge.sh/demo-viewer.html

What I need back:
- Did it work in Editor? âœ“/âœ—
- Did Quest show permission dialog? âœ“/âœ—
- Any errors?
- Unity version & Quest model

Full instructions in repo: DEVELOPER_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md

Thanks!
[Your name]
