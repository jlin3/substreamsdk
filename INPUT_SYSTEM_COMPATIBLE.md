# Updated: Works with ANY Input System! âœ…

The `SubstreamComplete.cs` script now **automatically detects** and works with whatever Input System your Unity project uses. No more errors!

## What's New?
- **Auto-detects** your Input System configuration
- Works with **ALL** Unity Input settings
- No manual configuration needed
- Added 'V' keyboard shortcut to open viewer

## How to Use:
1. Just drop `SubstreamComplete.cs` on any GameObject
2. Press Play
3. Click the button or use keyboard shortcuts!

## Keyboard Shortcuts:
- **S** - Start streaming
- **X** - Stop streaming
- **V** - Open viewer (when streaming)

## Automatic Compatibility!
The script automatically adapts to your project settings:
- âœ… **Input Manager (Old)** - Uses `Input.GetKeyDown()`
- âœ… **Input System Package (New)** - Uses `Keyboard.current`
- âœ… **Both** - Intelligently picks the right one

## How It Works:
The script uses Unity's conditional compilation to detect which Input System is active and uses the appropriate API. No setup required!

That's it! Happy streaming! ðŸŽ®
