# Unity Package Creation Instructions

## What You Need to Do:

Since Unity packages (`.unitypackage` files) can only be created from within Unity Editor, here's exactly what the developer needs to do:

### Step 1: Prepare Files
All necessary files are in the `COMPLETE_UNITY_PACKAGE` folder:
- ✅ Scripts (Substream.cs, SimpleDemoScript.cs, DemoController.cs)
- ✅ Editor scripts (menu creation)
- ✅ Android manifest
- ⚠️ Missing: Android AAR library (needs to be built)

### Step 2: Build Android Library (if not done)
```bash
cd quest/android
./gradlew :substream:assembleRelease
# This creates: quest/android/substream/build/outputs/aar/substream-release.aar
```

### Step 3: Import to Unity
1. Open Unity (2019.4 or newer)
2. Create new project or use existing
3. Copy entire `COMPLETE_UNITY_PACKAGE` folder contents to `Assets/SubstreamSDK/`
4. If you built the AAR, copy it to `Assets/SubstreamSDK/Plugins/Android/`
5. Import the `StreamTestScene.unitypackage` you provided

### Step 4: Create Unity Package
1. In Unity: **Assets → Export Package**
2. Select the `SubstreamSDK` folder
3. Include all dependencies
4. Export as `SubstreamSDK_Complete.unitypackage`

### Step 5: What's Included
The final package will have:
- ✅ Your demo scene (from StreamTestScene)
- ✅ SimpleDemoScript (configured for LiveKit)
- ✅ SDK scripts
- ✅ Android native library
- ✅ Editor menu for easy setup
- ✅ Pre-configured LiveKit connection

## Quick Test After Import:
1. **GameObject → Substream → Create Demo Scene**
2. Press Play
3. Click "Start Stream"
4. View at: https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/substream-cnzdthyx/rooms

## What the Developer Gets:
- Complete working SDK
- Demo scene ready to use
- No additional setup needed
- LiveKit connection pre-configured
- Android/Quest support included

## Current Status:
- Scripts: ✅ Ready
- Demo Scene: ✅ Uses your StreamTestScene
- LiveKit Config: ✅ Pre-configured
- Android Library: ⚠️ Needs building (or use placeholder for testing)
