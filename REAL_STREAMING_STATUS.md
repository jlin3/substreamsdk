# Real Streaming Status üî¥

## Current State:
- **UI Works**: ‚úÖ Buttons, interface, room names
- **LiveKit Rooms**: ‚ùå Not actually created
- **Video Capture**: ‚ùå Not implemented  
- **WebRTC Stream**: ‚ùå Not connected

## Why 404 Error:
The rooms don't exist because we're not actually calling LiveKit's API to create them.

## Your LiveKit Credentials (Valid):
```
URL: wss://substream-cnzdthyx.livekit.cloud
API_KEY: APIbtpHuQYmSvTT
API_SECRET: RmbpdbNBZVkbAW8yW0K3ekrjwcdqIKNo6OQDwt0211Y
```

## Quick Solutions:

### 1. Use Unity Render Streaming (Recommended)
- Official Unity package
- Works with any WebRTC server
- Free and maintained

### 2. LiveKit Unity SDK 
- Download: https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity/releases
- Import package
- Use their connection samples

### 3. FMETP Stream Plugin
- The $100 plugin you mentioned
- Does work, but different architecture

## The Truth:
We built a beautiful UI demo, but the actual WebRTC video streaming part requires one of the above solutions. The current scripts are "mock" implementations showing what it would look like.

To actually stream Unity gameplay to LiveKit, you need a proper WebRTC implementation.
