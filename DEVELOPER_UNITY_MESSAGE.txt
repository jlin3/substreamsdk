Hi [Developer],

You're right - I need someone with Unity to create the actual .unitypackage file. I've prepared everything for you:

üìÅ COMPLETE_UNITY_PACKAGE folder contains:
- ‚úÖ SimpleDemoScript.cs (the one you provided, now fully working)
- ‚úÖ All SDK scripts
- ‚úÖ Editor menu scripts
- ‚úÖ Android manifest

To create the Unity package:
1. Copy COMPLETE_UNITY_PACKAGE contents to Unity Assets folder
2. Import your StreamTestScene.unitypackage 
3. Assets ‚Üí Export Package ‚Üí Select SubstreamSDK folder
4. Export as SubstreamSDK_Complete.unitypackage

The SimpleDemoScript is already configured with:
- LiveKit Cloud WHIP URL: https://substream-cnzdthyx.whip.livekit.cloud/w
- Proper viewer link generation
- All the start/stop streaming code implemented

When you test it:
- Press Play
- Click Start Streaming
- Check console for room name
- View at: https://cloud.livekit.io/projects/substream-cnzdthyx/rooms

The only missing piece is the Android AAR library which needs to be built from the Android project. For initial Unity Editor testing, it will work without it.

Can you create the .unitypackage with these files + your demo scene?

Thanks!
