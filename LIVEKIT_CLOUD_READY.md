# You Have LiveKit Cloud! üéâ

## Your Infrastructure is Ready:

```
URL: wss://substream-cnzdthyx.livekit.cloud
API_KEY: APIbtpHuQYmSvTT  
API_SECRET: RmbpdbNBZVkbAW8yW0K3ekrjwcdqIKNo6OQDwt0211Y
```

This gives you:
- ‚úÖ Signaling server (managed)
- ‚úÖ STUN/TURN servers (global)
- ‚úÖ Recording capabilities
- ‚úÖ Scalable infrastructure
- ‚úÖ No server management!

## What's Missing: Unity Video Capture

LiveKit Cloud handles everything EXCEPT capturing Unity's video. For that, you need ONE of:

### Option A: LiveKit Unity SDK (Recommended)
```csharp
// With LiveKit Unity SDK imported:
Room room = new Room();
await room.Connect(url, token);
await room.LocalParticipant.SetCameraEnabled(true);
```

**Status**: The SDK exists but video capture from Unity needs setup

### Option B: Unity Render Streaming ‚Üí WHIP
1. Use Unity Render Streaming to capture
2. Send to LiveKit via WHIP endpoint
3. Works but more complex

### Option C: Screen Capture Approach  
- Capture entire screen/window
- Less elegant but works immediately

## The Current Scripts:

**SubstreamComplete.cs** - UI demo (no video)
**SubstreamLiveKitCloud.cs** - Creates real rooms (no video)

Both connect to YOUR LiveKit Cloud and create rooms viewers can join. They just don't send video yet.

## To Enable Video TODAY:

1. **Download LiveKit Unity SDK**
   - https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity/releases
   - Import the .unitypackage

2. **Modify SubstreamLiveKitCloud.cs**
   - Uncomment the SDK connection code
   - Add camera track publishing

3. **That's it!**
   - Your LiveKit Cloud handles everything else
   - Viewers join at meet.livekit.io

## Why We Went in Circles:

We kept trying to avoid requiring the LiveKit Unity SDK import, but that's what actually captures and encodes the video. Your LiveKit Cloud infrastructure is perfect - we just need the client SDK to use it!

## Bottom Line:

- ‚úÖ You have all the infrastructure (LiveKit Cloud)
- ‚úÖ The scripts create real rooms  
- ‚è≥ Just need LiveKit Unity SDK for video
- üöÄ Then you have real streaming!
