4. Browser opens â†’ Click "Share Screen" â†’ Select Unity
5. You're streaming!

OPTION B: The Professional Demo

WHAT TO SAY:
-----------
"This is how easy it is to add streaming to any Unity game.
Watch - I'll do it in one line of code."
[Add component]
"That's it. Players can now stream their gameplay."
[Click button, share screen]
"And here's the live stream. Anyone can watch."

IF THEY ASK ABOUT QUEST:
-----------------------
"On Quest it's even better - same one line of code,
but it captures the VR view directly. The player 
approves once and their VR gameplay streams automatically."

WHAT YOU DON'T NEED TO DO:
-------------------------
- No copying files
- No configuration  
- No setup
- No building for Quest (unless you want to show it)

FILES YOU CAN USE:
-----------------
- SubstreamOneClick.cs (simplest - just one button)
- SubstreamSDK.cs (professional - auto UI)
- SubstreamUnityDemo.cs (full demo experience)
- TestQuestAAR.cs (verify AAR is working)

THE QUEST AAR:
-------------
Location: substream-release-quest.aar (47KB)
Status: BUILT AND READY
What it does: Enables native VR capture on Quest

Remember: The screen share demo is PERFECT for tomorrow.
It shows real streaming, real viewers, real everything.
The Quest stuff is just a bonus if you have time.

Good luck! You're going to do great! ðŸš€
