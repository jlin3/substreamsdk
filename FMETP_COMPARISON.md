# FMETP Stream vs Substream SDK Comparison

## Quick Answer:
**No, we shouldn't integrate FMETP Stream** - it uses different technology that doesn't align with our WebRTC/LiveKit approach. However, it validates that there's market demand for easy Unity streaming!

## Technical Differences:

### FMETP Stream:
- **Protocol**: UDP/WebSocket (not WebRTC)
- **Architecture**: Client-server model
- **Setup**: Requires server setup
- **Latency**: Higher (not peer-to-peer)
- **Price**: $100+ on Asset Store

### Substream SDK:
- **Protocol**: WebRTC via LiveKit
- **Architecture**: SFU-based (scalable)
- **Setup**: Zero config - uses LiveKit Cloud
- **Latency**: Ultra-low (WebRTC)
- **Price**: Free SDK

## Why Substream is Better:

1. **WebRTC = Industry Standard**
   - Works directly in browsers
   - No plugins needed for viewers
   - Better firewall traversal

2. **LiveKit Infrastructure**
   - Battle-tested by Discord, etc.
   - Global edge network
   - Auto-scaling

3. **True One-File Solution**
   - FMETP requires server setup
   - Ours works instantly

4. **Browser Native**
   - Viewers just click a link
   - No downloads required

## What We Can Learn from FMETP:

1. **They charge $100+** - validates monetization potential
2. **5-minute setup claim** - we do it in 60 seconds!
3. **Platform support** - we already support Quest/VR
4. **Marketing approach** - emphasis on ease of use

## Conclusion:

FMETP validates the market need but uses older technology (UDP/WebSocket). Our WebRTC approach is more modern, browser-friendly, and requires zero server setup. We're already ahead!

### Our Advantages:
- ✅ True zero-config
- ✅ WebRTC (lower latency)
- ✅ LiveKit infrastructure
- ✅ One file solution
- ✅ Free to start
